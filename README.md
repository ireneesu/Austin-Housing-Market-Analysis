### Project Overview 
 The project mainly focuses on the analysis of house prices in the Austin area. I worked with Qingci Luo, Yisheng Chen and Chang Wang to solve the problems as a group. We are trying to find what are the main features that influence the real estate sale price in Austin, as the Austin Housing market was one of the hottest markets in 2021, and these listings show how that market has changed over the past couple of years. The project includes the entire process of analyzing the data, cleaning the data, picking relevant features, modeling, and evaluation.
